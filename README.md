## Requirements

- After a recent Job Interview containing lots of Java projects, I realised I need to get back into the Java world. I had just finished Lab1 of CS50 containing a "Greedy Algorithm" and I decided to translate it over to Java. The main reason is CS50 uses American coins (has a 1cent coin), so any number is achieveable. In Australia our lowest dominination is 5c so there needs to be some rounding logic. This was also a great way to move away from procedural programming and get back into OOP.
- More to come
