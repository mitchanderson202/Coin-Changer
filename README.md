## Requirements

- After a recent Job Interview containing lots of Java projects, I realised I need to get back into the Java world. I had just finished Lab1 of CS50 containing a "Greedy Algorithm" and I decided to translate it over to Java. The main reason is CS50 uses American coins (has a 1cent coin), so any number is achieveable. In Australia our lowest dominination is 5c so there needs to be some rounding logic. This was also a great way to move away from procedural programming and get back into OOP.
- I used shorts instead of bytes to allow a little bit of fun with the amounts, I haven't used $1 or $2 either. Just the Silver coins (50c, 20c, 10c, 5c).
- More to come

## Build Steps

- git clone https://github.com/mitchanderson202/Coin-Changer.git
- open in terminal or IDE of choice and run App.java file

---

## Features

- Shows the Minimum amount of coins needed to hand a customer change in AUD.
- Shows exactly which coins to give the customer.

---

## Known issues
